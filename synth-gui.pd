#X text 1078 49 This is my attempt at making a polyphonic 16 voice
additive synthesizer. It's pretty basic in terms of functionality.
You can control the "volume" of each of the 32 harmonics that are being
summed into the combined waveform with the the sliders below. There
are also sliders to control the even and odd harmonics simultaneously.
There is a VCA for controling the loudness contour and a VCF for controlling
the filter. The filter envelope is pretty broken right now and I'm
not sure how to fix it. However \, the cutoff and resonance sliders
for the actual filter behave the way they should. There is also an
LFO for controlling vibrato. I created some presets that I liked that
you can switch to using the colored buttons. I achieved polyphony by
creating a "voice" abstraction that contains the oscillators and envelope
functionality. The voice abstraction receives information from the
GUI via a bunch of sends. I added some volume control to keep the signal
from getting louder when you add in more harmonics. I used the ceammc
external for the resonant filter abstraction and I used cyclone for
one abstraction \, but I honestly can't remember what it was.;
